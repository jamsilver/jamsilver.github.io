    <p>I tried to get my daughter to make chocolate brownies with me. A much-loved recipe handed down from an old friend. She obediently sprinkled in the chocolate drops and marshmallows as directed.</p>

    <p>And it was.. fun. Yeah, it was <em>OK</em>.</p>

    <p>But the thing she <em>really delighted</em> in doing‚Äìand it didn‚Äôt take long for her to get on to it‚Äìwas dancing around, arms akimbo, wearing nothing but an apron, distributing plates to us‚Äìa proud cafe owner. üòÇ</p>

    <p>I suppose serving and eating the brownies was the segue. Still joining in with her dad‚Äôs plan‚Äìor hmm‚Äì<em>maybe it‚Äôs more.. historical starting point?</em></p>

    <p>Ahh I <em>loved</em> it. Laugh out loud funny. <em>So pleasing</em>. The sheer knows-she‚Äôs-loved, feels-seen, is-safe,</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>herselfness</em></p>

    <p>of it all ü•∞.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>We glanced at each other. <em>Did she get this particular wonderful-oddness from you or me? Lol. Seems kinda unique to her..</em></p>

    <hr>

    <p>Why would I make her word-out a justification for her oddness? For being the way she is. She just <em>is</em>, I just want her to know she‚Äôs</p>

    <p>Seen.</p>

    <p>Known.</p>

    <p><em>And then the universe will glow.</em></p>

    <hr>
    <hr>

    <p>Was I 15 or 16? There or there abouts.</p>

    <p>Lying on my bed. In my room. Door shut. Alone. Frozen. Stuck. I‚Äôd been like this for a while. Weeks?</p>

    <p>Eventually the tears came, though I tried to stop them. Then the weeping. Then the uncontrollable sobbing.</p>

    <p><em>Bury it! Gulp it down! I can‚Äôt let anyone hear. How could I explain it?</em></p>

    <p><em>Well. I couldn‚Äôt. I.. just.. can‚Äôt can I? They can‚Äôt know.</em></p>

    <p><em>I will be alone forever. No one can ever find this out. No. Nothing can ever give me away!</em></p>

    <p><em>Ohh the sadness. The aching, endless loneliness.</em></p>

    <hr>

    <p>And then. It happened.</p>

    <p>I was just a witness. My heart spoke all by itself.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Jesus, if following you means every day feels like this. I will do it. I love you.</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>It was obvious to everyone present that I truly meant it.</p>

    <p>And slowly. Then quickly. Then all at once.</p>

    <p><em>The universe‚Ä¶ it‚Ä¶</em></p>

    <hr>

    <p>It was like a crack opened in my bedroom wall and through it seeped some water. And it steadily dissolved the wall. And grew and grew. A trickle. Then a stream. Now a river. And soon a raging, surging, powerful, timeless, deafening, roaring cataract. Sourced from‚Ä¶somewhere else. Breaking‚Äìbroken‚Äìthrough.</p>

    <p>I lay there. Sopping. Astonished. <em>Drowned</em>. Tears confused. <em>What is this?</em> Is this‚Ä¶fatherly? Wow. Yes. Ha ha ha ha ha. <em>What?!?</em></p>

    <p>My tears of sadness morphed absurdly into tears of relief and happiness. And then more laughing. And then I sat. Then rose. Ha ha. Did I dance? Maybe I did!</p>

    <p>Seen.</p>

    <p>Known.</p>

    <p>I had a meeting with the church elders last week. And I told them at this point I only know one thing: that I trust Jesus‚Äìthe person‚Äìwith my same-sex attraction.</p>

    <p><em>Absolutely everything else?</em> I‚Äôm re-examining it. And I‚Äôm really not in a rush to be honest.</p>

    <p>Perhaps I‚Äôm remembering the important thing about this is not that <em>any of my teenage framing of that moment was correct</em>. Nor that <em>the matters I was catechized in during my twenties apply</em>.</p>

    <p>No.</p>

    <p>The most important thing here is this: <em>He saw me</em>.</p>

    <p><em>He saw me</em></p>

    <p><em>He sees me. And knows me.</em></p>

    <hr>

    <p>Fifteens years ago I was a young Warwick student. I was talking to the same elder about joining the same church. I remember explaining that for different people loving action looks very different. <em>Perhaps some people are very weak</em> I was saying. <em>Perhaps all they can do is hold open a door for one other person?</em></p>

    <p>I knew Jesus you see. I knew that would be enough for Him.</p>

    <hr>
    <blockquote>
      <p>He is<br>
    <br>
    He knows me<br>
    <br>
    Therefore<br>
    <br>
    I exist</p>

    <p>I remember the song I made for you,</p>

    <p>and played for two in a music room.</p>

    <p>‚ÄúYou are very beautiful.‚Äù</p>

    <p>You were. I knew.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>I remember the snow, it whirled around,</p>

    <p>and lit by lamp we stopped and found</p>

    <p>our fingers, lips and cold nose-tips.</p>

    <p>Together.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>I remember I tied a loop of string</p>

    <p>‚Äìa stand in for the later ring‚Äì</p>

    <p>and, confident in Christ as King,</p>

    <p>lowered to one knee.</p>

    <hr>
    <hr>

    <p>I remember knowing that sure as sure,</p>

    <p>I‚Äôd be alone forevermore.</p>

    <p>So how on earth has it come to this?!</p>

    <p>A <em>girl</em> friend together in married bliss?!</p>

    <p>Praise Jesus for such an amazing gift!</p>

    <p>And dance around the room my friends.</p>

    <p>Dance around the room!</p>

    <hr>
    <hr>

    <p>I remember the night I went to walk</p>

    <p>to clear my thoughts but unearthed more.</p>

    <p>And falling on the toilet floor.</p>

    <p>And‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶ then?</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Well, then I start to hit a wall.</p>

    <p>A toxic smog obscures it all.</p>

    <p>The fog of some infernal war.</p>

    <p>Inward rages. Terrifying cages.</p>

    <p>Progress coming in bizarre, drawn-out stages.</p>

    <p>Years pass. My daughter ages.</p>

    <hr>
    <hr>

    <p>I remember knowing that sure as sure,</p>

    <p>we‚Äôd be together forevermore.</p>

    <p>So how on earth has it come to this?</p>

    <p><em>How On Earth Has It Come To This?</em></p>

    <hr>
    <hr>

    <p>Well.</p>

    <p>I remember (now) God is no monster,</p>

    <p>and I‚Äôll be depressed no longer.</p>

    <p>Praise Jesus for the storm is over!</p>

    <p>Even if you won‚Äôt dance around the room my friends.</p>

    <p>Dance around the room.</p>

    <p>A graveyard. Packed with jumbled stones. The printed names too small to see.</p>

    <p>I stop. And watch. And feel a gaze. I hear a strange soliloquy.</p>

    <p>Is this a crowd of witnesses? Races run, their darkness past?</p>

    <p>To one more son of theirs who as from darkness is now running fast?</p>

    <hr>

    <p>One stone stands blank. Stares out right at me. Words as yet unfixed. Un-graved.</p>

    <p>Set out, it waits. For one last son to end his story with the saved.</p>

    <p>To add his voice to mother‚Äôs. Joined in fall, but led and made sublime:</p>

    <p>And simply hymn the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit divine.</p>
