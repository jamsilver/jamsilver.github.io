          <p>I’m angry.</p>

          <p>My youth stole away.</p>

          <p>Amid a strange night.</p>

          <p>“It’s like I’ve died!”</p>

          <p>“Stop exaggerating”, someone implied.</p>

          <p>But he and I are not alike.</p>

          <p>It seems to me he’s just stronger.</p>

          <p>A tad bit younger</p>

          <p>Still got a little longer.</p>

          <p>Everything is a pain,</p>

          <p>When you feel the force of every strain.</p>

          <p>Every cold wind and hot glare.</p>

          <p>When the refuge of denial is not there.</p>

          <p>And tomorrow’s energy is earnt today,</p>

          <p>And might fail to appear anyway.</p>

          <p>Every time this question sits:</p>

          <p>“Is it worth it?”</p>

          <p>Every time I must insist</p>

          <p>“Yes”</p>

          <p>(Except when it’s “No”)</p>

          <p>I remember when everything felt cheap</p>

          <p>I just did what seemed to please</p>

          <p>Whatever was in front of me</p>

          <p><em>Certain</em> God was leading me</p>

          <p>And ground gave way easily</p>

          <p>But now?</p>

          <p>Daily life has become a… tapestry</p>

          <p>A dance</p>

          <p>A complex negotiation with France</p>

          <p>More about style and rhythm</p>

          <p>–the threads you weaved</p>

          <p>Than direction or miles driven</p>

          <p>–what you achieved</p>

          <p>And I think the thing that bothers me most of all</p>

          <p>Is it’s normally</p>

          <p>incredibly</p>

          <p>dull.</p>

          <p>Resentments arise</p>

          <p>(In whatever disguise)</p>

          <p>when you hold up <a href="#therefore-i-exist">a sacrifice</a></p>

          <p>That is despised,</p>

          <p>That involved a lie</p>

          <p><em>Surprise!</em></p>

          <p>Is so absurd–nuclear-grade–</p>

          <p>And the illusion contained</p>

          <p>such trauma and pain</p>

          <p>Well.</p>

          <p>It’s hard to become human again.</p>

          <p>It turns out that hating and pushing away</p>

          <p>My feelings for men–my being gay</p>

          <p>and with it–in time–my personality</p>

          <p>Was not really the right Way</p>

          <p>It doesn’t particularly impress Mum, <a
              href="https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10102566686542004&amp;id=61301511">Church</a> or Wife,</p>

          <p>It didn’t grow the fruit of a righteous life</p>

          <p>Why did so many things seem to tell me it might?</p>

          <p>Why didn’t my “Christian ethos” boys school correct that at first?!</p>

          <p>Why did my <em>return-to-New-Testament-principles</em> twenties make it worse?</p>

          <p>I don’t know and now I don’t care.</p>

          <p>But still I must decide.</p>

          <p>Am I going to cling onto being a martyr</p>

          <p>To save face (or for fear of losing my faith</p>

          <p>as if it <a href="#therefore-i-exist">wasn’t Him who first chased</a></p>

          <p>and holds me by his grace)?</p>

          <p>And am I going to stubbornly wait</p>

          <p>For others to change to accommodate my <a
              href="https://www.relatenow.co.uk/content/mens-mother-complex-rape-heart">self-inflicted wound</a>?</p>

          <p>Expect my family to work around a self-depreciating, confused, insensitive tool?</p>

          <p>Encode more hidden loathing for men and women into the next generation too?</p>

          <p><span style="font-size:48px">Nope</span></p>

          <p>I don’t yet have all the needed answers I’m afraid</p>

          <p>But I know I’m not here to form a crusade</p>

          <p>Or man some “Reformation” barricade</p>

          <p>Or secretly build a boys brigade</p>

          <p>I’m here to seek first the Kingdom of Love again</p>

          <p>Where the King didn’t cling onto heavenly fealty</p>

          <p>But revealed himself in full human frailty</p>

          <p>And I went to a “Christian ethos” boys school you see</p>

          <p>So I intuit a bit about what that’s meant to be</p>

          <p>And I can sense what produces it in my heart and what does not.</p>

          <p>I’m sorry the dreams of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_solae">Sola this and Sola that</a></p>

          <p>Have so far fired blanks–for me–are falling down flat</p>

          <p>And I’m sorry that seeking comfort in a rigid evangelical frame,</p>

          <p>produced denial and loathing and shame.</p>

          <p>(And <em>Just So</em> stories of why <em>my</em> group of fools</p>

          <p>are more ✌🏻Pure and True✌🏻</p>

          <p>Than <em>those other</em> unfaithful, sell out crews).</p>

          <hr>

          <p>Today I’ll celebrate the World’s Mighty Creator,</p>

          <p>And Powerful Sustainer, And Wise Orchestrator,</p>

          <p>Arriving as a baby, sleeping in an animal-feed manger.</p>

          <p>And that’s quite enough.</p>

          <p>I’ll wager.</p>

          <p>I tried to get my daughter to make chocolate brownies with me. A much-loved recipe handed down from an old
            friend. She obediently sprinkled in the chocolate drops and marshmallows as directed.</p>

          <p>And it was.. fun. Yeah, it was <em>OK</em>.</p>

          <p>But the thing she <em>really delighted</em> in doing–and it didn’t take long for her to get on to it–was
            dancing around, arms akimbo, wearing nothing but an apron, distributing plates to us–a proud cafe owner. 😂
          </p>

          <p>I suppose serving and eating the brownies was the segue. Still joining in with her dad’s plan–or
            hmm–<em>maybe it’s more.. historical starting point?</em></p>

          <p>Ahh I <em>loved</em> it. Laugh out loud funny. <em>So pleasing</em>. The sheer knows-she’s-loved,
            feels-seen, is-safe,</p>

          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>herselfness</em></p>

          <p>of it all 🥰.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>We glanced at each other. <em>Did she get this particular wonderful-oddness from you or me? Lol. Seems
              kinda unique to her..</em></p>

          <hr>

          <p>Why would I make her word-out a justification for her oddness? For being the way she is. She just
            <em>is</em>, I just want her to know she’s
          </p>

          <p>Seen.</p>

          <p>Known.</p>

          <p><em>And then the universe will glow.</em></p>

          <hr>
          <hr>

          <p>Was I 15 or 16? There or there abouts.</p>

          <p>Lying on my bed. In my room. Door shut. Alone. Frozen. Stuck. I’d been like this for a while. Weeks?</p>

          <p>Eventually the tears came, though I tried to stop them. Then the weeping. Then the uncontrollable sobbing.
          </p>

          <p><em>Bury it! Gulp it down! I can’t let anyone hear. How could I explain it?</em></p>

          <p><em>Well. I couldn’t. I.. just.. can’t can I? They can’t know.</em></p>

          <p><em>I will be alone forever. No one can ever find this out. No. Nothing can ever give me away!</em></p>

          <p><em>Ohh the sadness. The aching, endless loneliness.</em></p>

          <hr>

          <p>And then. It happened.</p>

          <p>I was just a witness. My heart spoke all by itself.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p><em>Jesus, if following you means every day feels like this. I will do it. I love you.</em></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>It was obvious to everyone present that I truly meant it.</p>

          <p>And slowly. Then quickly. Then all at once.</p>

          <p><em>The universe… it…</em></p>

          <hr>

          <p>It was like a crack opened in my bedroom wall and through it seeped some water. And it steadily dissolved
            the wall. And grew and grew. A trickle. Then a stream. Now a river. And soon a raging, surging, powerful,
            timeless, deafening, roaring cataract. Sourced from…somewhere else. Breaking–broken–through.</p>

          <p>I lay there. Sopping. Astonished. <em>Drowned</em>. Tears confused. <em>What is this?</em> Is
            this…fatherly? Wow. Yes. Ha ha ha ha ha. <em>What?!?</em></p>

          <p>My tears of sadness morphed absurdly into tears of relief and happiness. And then more laughing. And then I
            sat. Then rose. Ha ha. Did I dance? Maybe I did!</p>

          <p>Seen.</p>

          <p>Known.</p>

          <hr>
          <hr>

          <p>I had a meeting with the church elders last week. And I told them at this point I only know one thing: that
            I trust Jesus–the person–with my same-sex attraction.</p>

          <p><em>Absolutely everything else?</em> I’m re-examining it. And I’m really not in a rush to be honest.</p>

          <p>Perhaps I’m remembering the important thing about this is not that <em>any of my teenage framing of that
              moment was correct</em>. Nor that <em>the matters I was catechized in during my twenties apply</em>.</p>

          <p>No.</p>

          <p>The most important thing here is this: <em>He saw me</em>.</p>

          <p><em>He saw me</em></p>

          <p><em>He sees me. And knows me.</em></p>

          <hr>

          <p>Fifteens years ago I was a young Warwick student. I was talking to the same elder about joining the same
            church. I remember explaining that for different people loving action looks very different. <em>Perhaps some
              people are very weak</em> I was saying. <em>Perhaps all they can do is hold open a door for one other
              person?</em></p>

          <p>I knew Jesus you see. I knew that would be enough for Him.</p>

          <hr>
          <blockquote>
            <p>He is<br>
              <br>
              He knows me<br>
              <br>
              Therefore<br>
              <br>
              I exist

          <p>I remember the song I made for you,</p>

          <p>and played for two in a music room.</p>

          <p>“You are very beautiful.”</p>

          <p>You were. I knew.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>I remember the snow, it whirled around,</p>

          <p>and lit by lamp we stopped and found</p>

          <p>our fingers, lips and cold nose-tips.</p>

          <p>Together.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>I remember I tied a loop of string</p>

          <p>–a stand in for the later ring–</p>

          <p>and, confident in Christ as King,</p>

          <p>lowered to one knee.</p>

          <hr>
          <hr>

          <p>I remember knowing that sure as sure,</p>

          <p>I’d be alone forevermore.</p>

          <p>So how on earth has it come to this?!</p>

          <p>A <em>girl</em> friend together in married bliss?!</p>

          <p>Praise Jesus for such an amazing gift!</p>

          <p>And dance around the room my friends.</p>

          <p>Dance around the room!</p>

          <hr>
          <hr>

          <p>I remember the night I went to walk</p>

          <p>to clear my thoughts but unearthed more.</p>

          <p>And falling on the toilet floor.</p>

          <p>And…and… then?</p>

          <hr>

          <p>Well, then I start to hit a wall.</p>

          <p>A toxic smog obscures it all.</p>

          <p>The fog of some infernal war.</p>

          <p>Inward rages. Terrifying cages.</p>

          <p>Progress coming in bizarre, drawn-out stages.</p>

          <p>Years pass. My daughter ages.</p>

          <hr>
          <hr>

          <p>I remember knowing that sure as sure,</p>

          <p>we’d be together forevermore.</p>

          <p>So how on earth has it come to this?</p>

          <p><em>How On Earth Has It Come To This?</em></p>

          <hr>
          <hr>

          <p>Well.</p>

          <p>I remember (now) God is no monster,</p>

          <p>and I’ll be depressed no longer.</p>

          <p>Praise Jesus for the storm is over!</p>

          <p>Even if you won’t dance around the room my friends.</p>

          <p>Dance around the room.</p>

          <p>A graveyard. Packed with jumbled stones. The printed names too small to see.</p>

          <p>I stop. And watch. And feel a gaze. I hear a strange soliloquy.</p>

          <p>Is this a crowd of witnesses? Races run, their darkness past?</p>

          <p>To one more son of theirs who as from darkness is now running fast?</p>

          <hr>

          <p>One stone stands blank. Stares out right at me. Words as yet unfixed. Un-graved.</p>

          <p>Set out, it waits. For one last son to end his story with the saved.</p>

          <p>To add his voice to mother’s. Joined in fall, but led and made sublime:</p>

          <p>And simply hymn the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit divine.</p>
